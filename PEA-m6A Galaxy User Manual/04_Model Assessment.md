- PEA-m6A server can be accessed via http://peam6a.omstudio.cloud

## PEA-m6A Model Assessment

This module accesses the consturction of each feature to the model output by using the Shapley Additive Explanations(SHAP) algorithms.

## Features importance analysis

This function accesses the consturction of each feature to the model output by using the Shapley Additive Explanations(SHAP) algorithms. SHAP assigns each feature an importance score using the classical Shapley values from game theory and its extensions: the higher its importance score, the greater the influence of that feature upon the model. The SHAP summary plot visualizes the influence of each feature on the model output ,and the SHAP dependence plot depicts the association between two different features.

#### Input

- **Train sets**: which can be generated by function **Prediction System Constrction**
- **Features names in TXT format**
- **Predictive model in binary format**:which can be generated by function **Prediction System Constrction**

#### Output

- **The SHAP summary plot in PDF format**
- **The SHAP depenence plot in PDF format**
